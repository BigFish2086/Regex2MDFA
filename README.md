## üèÅ Get started <a name = "Install"></a>
- Using the ` main.py ` file

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BigFish2086/Regex2MDFA
cd Regex2MDFA
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
python ./main.py <REGEX>
```

- Or using the [notebook](./regex2mdfa.ipynb) provided here in the github link, however whenever changing the testcase/regex in hand,
make sure to re-run the whole notebook again, since it's just a compilation of all the files in the ` src ` folder
